# JAMSWA

Hello and welcome to JAMSWA!

This is a Shell Wrapper Utility Menu for managing a minecraft server on unix.


# Most Important detail:

You MUST set up your directory and .jar file in the jamswa.settings file.


# To Install:

I recommend navigating your working directory to your minecraft folder, and then run the following:

1.a git clone https://github.com/KirinFuji/JAMSWA.git

For the DEV version:

1.b git clone -b dev https://github.com/KirinFuji/JAMSWA.git

Then run the script.

2. JAMSWA/jamswa.sh

Then if desired, use the installer feature to make a symlink:

opt 6, then opt 1 or 2.

# Then run it from anywhere:

jamswa
