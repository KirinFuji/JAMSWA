# JAMSWA

Hello and welcome to JAMSWA!

This is a Shell Wrapper Menu for managing a minecraft server on unix.

This is going to be very user friendly when complete. Users will not need to read the code at all and simply add their variables to a .settings file.

I plan on making a server install script that will do a secure server install with a service user.

As of: 5/20/19

Currently I have a stable release version that does everything the menu says. 

I have tested it thoroughly and I am not seeing any more bugs.

Readme and documentatino will come soon.
