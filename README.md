Hello and welcome to JAMSWA!

This is a Shell Wrapper Menu for managing a minecraft server on unix.

This is going to be very user friendly when complete. Users will not need to read the code at all and simply add their variables to a .settings file.

It primarily utilizes GNU Screen to keep the server backgrounded.

I plan on making a server install script that will do a secure server install with a service user.11

This is currently in ultra baby alpha stages but is becomming more stable.
